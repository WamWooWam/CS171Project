// because humans are not computers, randomness is a *feeling* to us. we can't easily tell
// if something is or is not truly random, for example, if you take the list of numbers from 0-10
// and pick 5 at random without removing from the list, you may get multiple 4s, and to the casual
// observer, this doesn't *feel* random
//
// to alleviate this problem somewhat, we don't choose a random word from the list each and every
// game. we start by shuffling the list, then iterating through it one by one, meaning duplicates
// can't happen.
